        This app uses Spotify playlists to play with. Authentication is required to play and access them. Not all songs have a song preview on Spotify; as a result, there are usually fewer playable songs in a game than there are in the selected playlist. Speech recognition works best in English. Words in different languages can be difficult to recognize. Internet connection is needed while playing.\n\n
