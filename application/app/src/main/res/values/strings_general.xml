        This app uses Spotify playlists to play with. Authentication is required to play and access them. Private playlists can only be searched by their unique ID, they will not be listed by name. Not all songs have a song preview on Spotify. As a result, there are usually fewer playable songs in a game than there are in the selected playlist. Speech recognition works best in English. Words in different languages can be difficult to recognize. Internet connection is needed while playing.\n\n
