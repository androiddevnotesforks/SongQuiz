FEW WORDS FROM THE DEVELOPER

I always loved music trivia games, but I never found one which would have contained enough songs to be challenging in the long run. Song Quiz makes it possible to play on billions of playlists, solving this issue entirely for free. I hope you have as much fun with it as much as I did making it.
